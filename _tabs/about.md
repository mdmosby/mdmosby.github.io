I'm Matt Mosby. I've been a developer of high performance scientific software since 2009, focusing on simuluation of
large deformation solid mechanics and contact. In my rapidly approaching two decades of experience in research and
development institutions, I have spent far less than 50% of my time on theoretical and mathematical develpment, whereas
a much greater proportion of my time is focused on:
* learning about extracting performance from target architectures
* integrating software components in complex HPC environments and systems
* teaching others about software development best practices and modern tools (like, `vim` is great but it's not _that_ great)
* project management, organization, and communication

This blog is an attempt to organize and archive findings, thoughts, complaints and philosophy on the above.

_This blog is based on my personal opinion and in no way reflect the position(s) of my employer(s) whoever they may be at the time._
